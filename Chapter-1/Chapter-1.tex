\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter_1}

%% It is only necessary to list the authors if multiple people contributed
\noindent This document is intended to be both an example of the thesis template for \LaTeX, as well as a short introduction to its use. It is not intended to be a general introduction to \LaTeX{} itself,\footnote{We recommend \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX} as a reference and a starting point for new users.} and we will assume the reader to be familiar with the basics of creating and compiling documents. Instructions on how to use this template under Windows and Linux, and which \LaTeX{} packages are required, can be found in \texttt{README.txt}.
\section{Document Structure}
Since a thesis is a substantial document, it is convenient to break it up into smaller pieces. In this template we therefore give every chapter its own file. The chapters (and appendices) are gathered together in \texttt{thesis.tex}, which is the master file describing the overall structure of the document. \texttt{thesis.tex} starts with the line
%% We need an empty line before the quote environment to work around a bug in
%% the lettrine package, from which the drop command is derived.
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash documentclass\{thesis\}}
\end{quote}
which loads the thesis template. The template is based on the \LaTeX{} \texttt{book} document class and stored in \texttt{thesis.cls}. The document class accepts several comma-separated options. By default, hyperlinks are shown in cyan, which is convenient when reading the thesis on a computer, but can be expensive when printing. They can be turned black with the \texttt{print} option. This will also turn the headers dark gray instead of cyan. Moreover, it will add a 3~mm bleed around the page including crop marks. This will help the printer with the thumb indices, since they run right up to the page borders. Finally, the \texttt{nativefonts} option can be used to override the automatic font selection (see below).\\\\
A thesis is a big document, which makes it easy to miss warnings about the layout in the \LaTeX{} output. In order to locate problem areas, add the \texttt{draft} option to the \texttt{\textbackslash documentclass} line. This will display a vertical bar in the margins next to the paragraphs that require attention.\\\\
The contents of the thesis are included between the \texttt{\textbackslash begin\{document\}} and \texttt{\textbackslash end\{document\}} commands, and split into three parts by
\begin{enumerate}
\item\texttt{\textbackslash frontmatter}, which uses Roman numerals for the page numbers and is used for the title page and the table of contents;
\item\texttt{\textbackslash mainmatter}, which uses Arabic numerals for the page numbers and is the style for the chapters;
\item\texttt{\textbackslash appendix}, which uses letters for the chapter numbers, starting with `A'.
\end{enumerate}
The title page is defined in \texttt{title.tex} in the \texttt{title} folder and included verbatim with \texttt{\textbackslash include\{title/title\}},\footnote{Note that it is not necessary to specify the file extension.} (see below). Additionally, it is possible to include a preface, containing, for example, the acknowledgements. An example can be found in \texttt{preface.tex}. The table of contents is generated automatically with the \texttt{\textbackslash tableofcontents} command. Chapters are included after \texttt{\textbackslash mainmatter} and appendices after \texttt{\textbackslash appendix}. For example, \texttt{\textbackslash include\{chapter-1/chapter-1\}} includes \texttt{chapter-1.tex}, which contains this introduction.
\section{Title Page}
The title pages are defined in \texttt{title/title.tex}, which you will have to modify according to your needs. 
Since the thesis title and name of the can author appear several times throughout the document, special commands are provided so they only have to be specified once. The title (and optional subtitle) can be specified with
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash title[Subtitle]\{Title of the MSc Thesis\}}
\end{quote}
The name of the author is specified with
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash author\{First name\}\{Last name\}}
\end{quote}
Note that the first and last name are separate arguments, since they may be printed in different font shapes. The \texttt{\textbackslash title} and \texttt{\textbackslash author} commands also ensure that the title and author appear in the metadata of the final PDF.\\\\
See \texttt{title/title.tex} for detailed documentation on the comment and layout of the title pages.
\section{Chapters}
Each chapter has its own file. For example, the \LaTeX{} source of this chapter can be found in \texttt{chapter-1.tex}. A chapter starts with the command
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash chapter\{Chapter title\}}
\end{quote}
This starts a new page, prints the chapter number and title and adds a link in the table of contents. If the title is very long, it may be desirable to use a shorter version in the page headers and the table of contents. This can be achieved by specifying the short title in brackets:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash chapter[Short title]\{Very long title with many words which could not possibly fit on one line\}}
\end{quote}
Unnumbered chapters, such as the preface, can be created with \texttt{\textbackslash chapter*\{Chapter title\}}. Such a chapter will not show up in the table of contents or in the page header. To create a table of contents entry anyway, add
\begin{quote}
    \texttt{\textbackslash addcontentsline\{toc\}\{chapter\}\{Chapter title\}}
\end{quote}
after the \texttt{\textbackslash chapter} command. To print the chapter title in the page header, add
\begin{quote}
    \texttt{\textbackslash setheader\{Chapter title\}}
\end{quote}
\noindent Chapters are subdivided into sections, subsections, subsubsections, and, optionally, paragraphs and subparagraphs. All can have a title, but only sections and subsections are numbered. As with chapters, the numbering can be turned off by using \texttt{\textbackslash section*\{\ldots\}} instead of \texttt{\textbackslash section\{\ldots\}}, and similarly for the subsection.
\section{\textbackslash section\{\ldots\}}
\subsection{\textbackslash subsection\{\ldots\}}
\subsubsection{\textbackslash subsubsection\{\ldots\}}
\paragraph{\textbackslash paragraph\{\ldots\}}

\section{Fonts and Colors}
The fonts used by this template depend on which version of \LaTeX{} you use. Regular \LaTeX, \emph{i.e.}, if you compile your document with with \texttt{latex}, \texttt{pslatex} or \texttt{pdflatex}, will use Utopia for text, Fourier for math and Latin Modern for sans-serif and monospaced text. However, if you want to adhere to the TU Delft house style, you will need to use \XeLaTeX, as it supports TrueType and OpenType fonts. Compiling with \texttt{xelatex} will use Bookman Old Style for titles, Tahoma for text, Courier New for monospace and Cambria for math. If you want to use \XeLaTeX, but do not want to use the TU Delft house style fonts, you can add the \texttt{nativefonts} option to the document class.\\\\
This template supports the use of drop caps, a large colored initial at the beginning of a chapter or section, via the \texttt{\textbackslash dropcap} command:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\textbackslash dropcap\{L\}\{orem\} ipsum\ldots}
\end{quote}
The first argument is the capital that will be printed on two lines (in the title color), and the second argument is the rest of the word. Depending on the font, the latter may be printed in small caps.

The corporate colors of the RUG are red, black and white, available, respectively, via \texttt{\textbackslash color\{{\color{RUG-red}RUG-red}\}}, \texttt{\textbackslash color\{{\color{black}black}\}} (which differs slightly from the default \texttt{black}) and \texttt{\textbackslash color\{white\}}. Apart from these three, the template defines the basic colors
\begin{itemize}
%% Reduce the separation between the items, since this is just a list of words.
\itemsep 0pt
\parskip 0pt
\item\texttt{\color{RUG-red}RUG-red},
\item\texttt{\color{NFO-purple}NFO-purple},
\item\texttt{\color{dark-blue}dark-blue},
\item\texttt{\color{anthracite}anthracite},
\item\texttt{\color{sky-blue}sky-blue},
\item\texttt{\color{PW-Grey-1}PW-Grey-1},
\item\texttt{\color{PW-Grey-2}PW-Grey-2},
\item\texttt{\color{PW-Grey-3}PW-Grey-3},
\item\texttt{\color{PW-Grey-4}PW-Grey-4},
\item\texttt{\color{PW-Grey-5}PW-Grey-5},
\item\texttt{\color{ES-Viridis-1}ES-Viridis-1},
\item\texttt{\color{ES-Viridis-2}ES-Viridis-2},
\item\texttt{\color{ES-Viridis-3}ES-Viridis-3},
\item\texttt{\color{ES-Viridis-4}ES-Viridis-4},
\item\texttt{\color{ES-Viridis-5}ES-Viridis-5},
\end{itemize}

More colors can be added in the \texttt{thesis.cls} file.
